# Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) Character Generator

## Introduction

This character generator will randomly generate a **first name, family name, gender, race, alliance and class**. Who is this app for? 

* Players rolling their first character who aren't sure what to try first
* Players who have a character but aren't enjoying it and want to try something new
* Players who love alts and have the itch to try something different

## What will be generated

### Name and gender

The generator will produce a first and family name that is based on lore and appropriate to the race and gender that is generated. 

### Race and alliance

By default certain races belong to particular alliances in ESO, as seen in the table below. The Imperial does not belong to a specific alliance, so when you create one you can choose which alliance you prefer to side with.


Alliance            | Member Races
------------        | ------------
Daggerfall Covenant | Breton / Redguard / Orsimer
Ebonheart Pact      | Nord / Dunmer / Argonian
Aldmeri Dominion    | Altmer / Bosmer / Khajiit 
Player Choice       | Imperial

There is an "Any Race, Any Alliance" bundle that unlocks the ability to create characters of any Alliance regardless of race. The current version of the app assumes that this perk has not been unlocked, so the provided alliance correlate with the defaults, except in the case of Imperials when it is randomised. 

### Class

The current version of the app will provide a class, but not provide suggestions about how to build or play that class. All classes can be tanks/healers/dps depending on the stats and skills chosen. 

At the time of creation, ESO contains the following classes, which will be randomly selected by the app.

* Dragonknight
* Necromancer
* Nightblade
* Sorcerer
* Templar
* Warden
